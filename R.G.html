                <p>I'd sit alone and watch your light
                    My only friend through teenage nights
                    And everything I had to know
                    I heard it on my radio<br>
                </p>
                <p>You gave them all those old time stars
                    Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
                    You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
                    You made us feel like we could fly<br>
                </p>
                 <p>So don't become some background noise
                    A backdrop for the girls and boys
                    Who just don't know, or just don't care
                    And just complain when you're not there.<br>
