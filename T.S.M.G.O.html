                <p>Empty spaces, what are we living for?
                    Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
                    Does anybody know what we are looking for?
                    Another hero, another mindless crime
                    Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
                    Hold the line
                    Does anybody want to take it anymore?<br>
                </p>
                <p>The show must go on
                    The show must go on, yeah
                    Inside my heart is breaking
                    My makeup may be flaking
                    But my smile, still, stays on<br>
                </p>
                 <p>Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
                    Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
                    Does anybody know what we are living for?
                    I guess I'm learning
                    I must be warmer now
                    I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
                    Outside the dawn is breaking
                    But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free<br>
