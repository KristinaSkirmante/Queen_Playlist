                <p>Let's go
                  Steve walks warily down the street
                  With his brim pulled way down low
                  Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
                  Machine guns ready to go
                  Are you ready hey are you ready for this?
                  Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
                  Out of the doorway the bullets rip
                  To the sound of the beat yeah<br>
                </p>
                <p>Another one bites the dust
                  Another one bites the dust
                  And another one gone and another one gone
                  Another one bites the dust
                  Hey I'm gonna get you too
                  Another one bites the dust<br>
                </p>
                 <p>How do you think I'm going to get along
                  Without you when you're gone
                  You took me for everything that I had
                  And kicked me out on my own
                  Are you happy are you satisfied?
                  How long can you stand the heat
                  Out of the doorway the bullets rip
                  To the sound of the beat look out<br>
